* TODO [#B] Luxurious support for multiple projects
  BAST already supports multiple projects through --conf, but it can also
  provide a ready to use feature where you can just b[l]ast your configuration
  files, execute a sort of a run-all command and it works. run-all can actually
  be very independent. It will receive 2 parameters, the first is the to the
  configuration directory. The second is the time to sleep between each one.
